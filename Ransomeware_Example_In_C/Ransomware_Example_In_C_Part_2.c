// This is Part 2 of the Ransomware program, it shows an example technique of file decryption and payment validation.
// There are also some more facts and things you should know about Ransomware

// As always we start with the import statements:
// stdio.h is for displaying the ransom message and in Part 2 for putting in the proof of payment
// string.h is for dealing with the data as holding it in strings is an easy way to encrypt it
// openssl/evp.h has cryptography functions for the encryption and in Part 2 the decryption
// dirent.h is used to access directories allowing us to cover every level of depth the data is stored in
