# Identifying and Terminating Suspicious Connections
$ sudo netstat -antp | grep ':8080' | grep 'ESTABLISHED' | awk '{print $7}' | cut -d'/' -f1 | xargs kill
# This command identifies processes associated with the suspicious connections and terminates them

# Verifying Termination of Suspicious Connections
$ netstat -ant | grep ':8080' | grep 'ESTABLISHED'
# No output indicates that the connections have been successfully terminated

# Implementing Immediate Mitigation Measures
$ echo "POST requests exceeding 10 seconds will be dropped" | sudo tee /etc/httpd/conf.d/rudy_mitigation.conf
$ sudo systemctl restart httpd
# This adds a configuration rule to drop long-running POST requests and restarts the HTTP server to apply it
