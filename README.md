# Malware-Examples  
A collection of malware/viruses/spyware code (not for real use) designed to teach malware analysis

Each program is written in a separate file, using a variety of programming languages to accommodate all backgrounds.  
Along with each program's source code are comments describing how it works, and what to look out for.

This is purely an instructional repository of malware code.  
None of this is intended for real-life use and be forewarned that use of any of it is illegal almost anywhere in the world.  
Please use this repository as a way to learn Cybersecurity forensics.  
If there is a type of malware that you wish for me to create an example of for educational purposes, please leave a comment (include the language requested).

I hope that this can help people learn to protect themselves from these types of programs.

Thank you,
